# Overview

React Tree Table is a high performance React component designed to render data in a mixed tree and tabular format. This type of representation is ideal for all kinds of performance data (e.g. stacks or dependency graph).

# Usage

You may use SimpleReactTreeTable with a simplified data modal or you may use ReactTreeTable directly for better performance or if your data is too large or slow to fit fully in memory.
